    <h2>What is AI</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of technologies that allow computers to perform tasks that normally
        require human intelligence. AI uses algorithms, data, and computational power to simulate human intelligence. AI
        systems
        can learn and improve through exposure to large amounts of data, and can identify patterns and relationships
        that humans
        may miss.</p>
